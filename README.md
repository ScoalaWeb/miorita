# Miorița

Miorița is a sheep that can be controlled by writing code. This is its source code.

The app was developed as an aid for teaching fundamental principles of programming on the Romanian website [Școala Web](https://scoalaweb.ro).

## Technical details

This is a simple Vue Nuxt.js app, written with TypeScript, 
[Vue Class Components](https://class-component.vuejs.org/), 
and [Vue Property Decorators](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator#readme)

### Build Setup

If you are interested in running this locally, you can use the traditional Nuxt commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
