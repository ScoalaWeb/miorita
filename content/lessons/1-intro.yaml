                - Miorița is a sheep that can be programmed to move in her sheepfold.
                - To program her, you simply write instructions.
                - In this page, we will learn some of the things she can do.

            text:
                - Using the commands we learned, have Miorița go to the grass zone, beyond the wall.

workCode: |-
    // The following line makes Miorița turn to her right (clockwise, like the hands of old clocks).
    turnRight()

    // The following line makes Miorița move forward, in the direction she is facing.
    move()

    // Miorița cannot move outside the sheepfold, or cross any of the walls.
    // She always starts where you left her (maybe from previous runs).
    // The following line makes Miorița get back to her start position.
    reset()

    // BTW, these green lines of text are called "comments".
    // They allow programmers to write anything they want without it being executed.
    // They're great for describing what we did in the code,
    // for programmers who might look at the code again.

    // Every programming language has comments.
    // In the one we are using to control Miorița, there are two types of comments:
    //  1. Line comments, where everything after the first // is ignored on the same line
    //  2. Block comments, where everything after /* and before */ is ignored, even if it spans over multiple lines.

    // Now delete everything in this panel, and try to solve the challenge.
